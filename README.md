# Hi there! 👋 I'm Diego Achuuuuuurra

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a full-stack developer from Chile 🇨🇱, passionate about crafting scalable and impactful web applications. With expertise in **React.js**, **Django**, and **Business Intelligence**, I combine dynamic frontends with robust backend logic and services. I’ve also honed my skills in deploying across platforms like **Azure**, **AWS**, and **GCP**.

## 🚀 What I Do!

I thrive on creating digital solutions that drive results. From automating processes to optimizing data workflows, I’ve collaborated with organizations to build efficient and user-focused platforms. Some highlights include:

- **RedMaestra**: We’re talking about a full-scale human resources platform, built to adapt. SQL, NoSQL, microservices—all in one, modular structure that scaled effortlessly alongside the organization, adapting on demand to new requirements—even adding modules with AI models for smarter and more condensed insights.
- **GetSoftware**: 
  - **RescateFamiliar**: Say goodbye to manual entry. I built an app that automated over 8,500 patient entries. Centralized, efficient, and scalable. Dashboard? Check. Reports? Check. Time saved? Immeasurable.
  - **GuardianesCL**: Ever wondered how firefighters organize night shifts? This app does it all—transactional processing, alerts, and multimedia content management. It’s not just an app; it’s the command center for their night.

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

Currently, I’m focused on building applications that integrate machine learning insights and data analytics. My projects are designed to automate workflows, track performance, and enhance decision-making. 

Here’s a glimpse of what’s keeping me busy:

- **Event Management Tools**: Advanced platforms for tracking and scheduling.
- **Automation and Insights**: Integrating data pipelines with BI models to deliver actionable results.
- **Ticketing Systems**: Professional-grade platforms for handling support requests with real-time updates.
